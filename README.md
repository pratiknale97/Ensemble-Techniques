-> Data Description & Context:

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder marked by
decreased dopamine levels in the brain. It manifests itself through a deterioration
of movement, including the presence of tremors and stiffness. There is commonly
a marked effect on speech, including dysarthria (difficulty articulating sounds),
hypophonia (lowered volume), and monotone (reduced pitch range). Additionally,
cognitive impairments and changes in mood can occur, and risk of dementia is
increased.
Traditional diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease involves a clinician taking a
neurological history of the patient and observing motor skills in various situations.
Since there is no definitive laboratory test to diagnose PD, diagnosis is often
difficult, particularly in the early stages when motor effects are not yet severe.
Monitoring progression of the disease over time requires repeated clinic visits by
the patient. An effective screening process, particularly one that doesn’t require a
clinic visit, would be beneficial. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal
features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. If
machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to
accurately diagnosis PD, this would be an effective screening step prior to an
appointment with a clinician.

-> Learning Outcomes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Supervised Learning
3. Ensemble Learning

-> Objective:

Goal is to classify the patients into the respective labels using the attributes from
their voice recording
